# Wattometer Plugin

This plugin allows Android Runner to interact with a `watto-meter` board in
order to collect energy measurements. The plugin sends a simple HTTP request to
the board before and after each run.

## Configuration

In your `config.json` file add a section similar to:
```json
"profilers": {
    "wattometer": {
        "ip": "192.168.0.10",
        "experiment_name": "my_experiment"
    }
}
```

* `ip` – IP address of the board.
* `experiment_name` – Name that will be used as device name when measurements
  start.

## Behaviour

At the start of a run the plugin requests:
`http://<ip>/startMeasures?device=<experiment_name>`

When the run finishes it sends:
`http://<ip>/stopMeasures`

The board is expected to handle these endpoints as implemented in its
`APIManager`.
